REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_localbus/U_data_memory/U_ram/genblk1[1].RAM_reg_0 has an input control pin U_localbus/U_data_memory/U_ram/genblk1[1].RAM_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U_localbus/U_data_memory/U_ram/genblk1[1].RAM_reg_3_0[39]) which is driven by a register (u_top_core/u_top_execute/latch_execute_reg[55]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
